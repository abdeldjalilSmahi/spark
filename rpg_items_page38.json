Even when you swallow your fill of blood, the devil whispers in your ear, tempting you to drink more. Go hungry and the beast takes over. The beast is the relentless beating in your lifeless heart; it craves excess, cruelty, and destruction. When the beast wins, you lose your free will and devolve into a mindless monster. Your humanity \u2013 your connection to what it means to be human \u2013 is the only thing that holds the beast at bay, and it is a flickering flame in the windswept darkness. Between feast and famine, restraint and recklessness, a predator\u2019s unlife offers more than an eternal, blood-junkie existence. Immortality is the reward that awaits a predator who can balance on the knife edge.<br/>\nPredators are the apex: the union of man\u2019s scheming ingenuity and beast\u2019s instinctive ferocity. Though man and lesser creatures are sheep to the wolf, the wolf is among a pack of wolves. And in this pack, the most cunning and ruthless is the alpha. All predators envy that power and prestige. They nip at each other nightly, fighting over the scraps. Each hopes to one night rule the pack. Thus, from the greatest predator to the least, all are embroiled in a ceaseless conflict of intrigue and bloodshed.<br/>\nThis is what it means to be a predator.

(2012)", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/>\nItras by is a surreal role playing game set in a city reminiscent of Europe in the 1920\u2032s. The rule system is card based and focuses heavily on freeform and improvisation. Please also see the reviews section. Setting<br/>\nItras by labels itself a \u201csurreal role playing game\u201d. It\u2019s also been called a retro-surreal urban fable. The setting is a city, reminiscent of Western cities in the 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s. In the city center, reality is relatively stable, but the further afield you get, the more it deteriorates, mutates, becomes dream-like. In the setting chapter you\u2019ll find descriptions of dreams which have become real, mad scientists, an outline of a city strictly divided by class, sea elephants, the Machine God who lurks under the city, a gentleman with a monster in his basement, a description of the structural cancer that haunts some of the city\u2019s buildings and much more. We heartily encourage each group to make Itras by their own by changing, adapting, adding and subtracting. There are pulpish elements, horror elements, creepy surreal elements, all together in a strange blend we hope will inspire. System<br/>\nThe system is very simple and described in a few pages. The game pioneered the use of Matthiijs Holter\u2019s resolution cards (also featured in Love in the Time of Seid and the Swedish RPG S\u00e4gen), and has it\u2019s very own Chance Card system. The resolution cards function as a resolution mechanic, and read things like \u201cYes, but\u2026\u201d, \u201cNo, and\u2026\u201d, \u201cYes, and\u2026\u201d etc. The results are interpreted by players after the cards have been drawn. The Chance Cards can be drawn once per session by each player, and serve to infuse the game with surrealism. Some examples: Cut Scene: Jump forward three hours. Describe what conditions the characters find themselves in. You\u2019re not allowed to describe what has happened in the meantime. Nemesis! This card awakens the character\u2019s Nemesis. In some way, this arch enemy affects the situation. Exactly how is up to you. Doesn\u2019t the character have an arch enemy? Well, now she does. What\u2019s in its pockets? The character has something in her pocket which might be useful. What could it be? These cards are interpreted by the player who draws them. The book is chock full of advice on how to roleplay, be a gamemaster, plan a campaign, make an adventure, play with surrealism and more. I think it\u2019s as good as a beginner\u2019s game as for more experienced players", "genres": ["Weird / Surreal"], "categories": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"]}, {"url": "https://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/58657/beyond-countless-doorways", "titre": "Beyond Countless Doorways", "rank": "3,913", "rating": "8.0", "year": "Beyond Countless Doorways (2004)", "description": "From the publisher: Spice up your game with imaginative planar locations like you?ve never seen!
